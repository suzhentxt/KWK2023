        <i class="pink-tax">Pink tax</i>
        <span>
          refers to the higher prices often charged for products marketed
          towards women compared to similar products for men. This
          discriminatory pricing practice can be seen across various categories
          such as personal care products, clothing, toys, and other goods and
          services.</span

      <div class="visual-representations-such">
        Visual representations such as charts, graphs, or infographics may be
        used in the data visualisation to illustrate the gender-based pricing
        disparities resulting from the pink tax
      </div>
      <div class="financial-burden-on">FINANCIAL BURDEN ON WOMEN</div>
      <div class="the-pink-tax">
        The pink tax places an additional financial burden on women, as they are
        forced to pay more for essential goods and services compared to men.
        Over time, these extra costs can accumulate and contribute to economic
        disparities between genders.
      </div>
      <div class="the-pink-tax1">
        The pink tax perpetuates gender-based price discrimination, where
        products marketed towards women are priced higher solely based on gender
        stereotypes. This unfair pricing practice contributes to gender
        inequality and reinforces harmful gender norms.

      <div class="limited-purchasing-power">LIMITED PURCHASING POWER</div>
      <div class="higher-prices-for">
        Higher prices for products marketed towards women can limit their
        purchasing power and choices. Women may have to allocate more of their
        income to basic necessities due to the pink tax, leaving less room for
        discretionary spending or saving.
      </div>
      <div class="inequitable-access-to">
        INEQUITABLE ACCESS TO ESSENTIAL ITEMS
      </div>
      <div class="the-pink-tax2">
        The pink tax can make essential items, such as personal care products
        and hygiene items, more expensive for women. This can create barriers to
        access for individuals who may already face financial constraints,
        impacting their health, well-being, and overall quality of life.

      <div class="lack-of-transparency">LACK OF TRANSPARENCY</div>
      <div class="pricing-practices-and">
        Pricing practices and the pink tax itself may not always be clearly
        communicated or disclosed to consumers. Lack of transparency makes it
        challenging for consumers to make informed choices and advocate for
        fairer pricing
      </div>
      <div class="cumulative-impact">CUMULATIVE IMPACT</div>
      <div class="addressing-the-problem">
        Addressing the problem of the pink tax requires raising awareness,
        advocating for fair pricing practices, and promoting gender-neutral
        pricing. It involves challenging gender stereotypes, supporting policy
        changes, and encouraging transparency in pricing.
      </div>
      <div class="the-pink-taxs">
        The pink tax's cumulative impact on women's finances can be significant,
        particularly considering that it affects a wide range of products and
        services. This can perpetuate financial inequalities and hinder progress
        towards gender equality.
